# goals-2025

Just a checklist of things I hopefully would like to get out in 2025

- [ ] Deploy an app on Fly.io using `Go`. Create a repo that shows the start to finish
- [ ] Creating 5 Tech videos, purely for fun
   - [ ] Using TUI's and some APIs 
- [ ] Read 12 books (tech related). Will update this README with the books I've read
  - [ ] Designing data intensive stuff
  - [ ] Staff Engineer: Individal Contributor thingy 
- [ ] Creating 20 different usages of `Redis` + `Go` to learn about it, that uses Docker, available in a single repo
- [ ] TODO
